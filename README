This project was started in 2008 with the intention of developing a
model for species diversification. However the code is not currently
being maintained (and has not been maintained for several years) and
the current status is unknown, unfortunately. The project developers
(Ganeshkumar Ganapathy, Perry Zheng and Tally Balaban) have moved on
to other positions, and little future development is expected in this
project.
